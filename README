# From source code to execution

This tool allow to edit a source code in a web page
and see all the stages from compilation to execution:

  * Source code edition
  * Lexical analysis
  * Syntaxical analysis
  * Abstract Syntax Tree
  * Code optimization
  * Assembly generation
  * Machine code generation
  * Processor execution
  * Screen display

When moving the cursor in the source code,
the 8 next stages are updated to highlight
the consequence the last instruction.

When the processor executes an instruction, previous
stages highlight execute/read/write/modify in
the assembly, code, heap and stack.


## How to use

The tool is coded in Python and then translated into
JavaScript to be executed on the browser.

Type 'make' to generate 'xxx.js'

Goto [pedago.html](http://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/thierry.excoffier/PARSER/pedago.html)
to see the result.

## How to enhance

This project is based on functionality programming.
So to add a functionality, it is not necessary to modify files.
You only add your functionality in a new file.

The source filenames start by a number defining the order
of functionality addition.
A good starting point is '0100-put.py'.
It defines a new language element modifying the 8 stages
displayed on the screen.
